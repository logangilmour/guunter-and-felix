Rain

I hear the rain,
The pitter-patter through the grass into my brain.
It's all the same, 
where a trickle is a laugh without a name.

And we catch fire
on the tip of thunders crack.
Though we were tired
the lightning brought us back

from deathly sleep.
Our fraying bodies are the gardeners that keep
a bit of life
from getting mixed up in the entropy and strife

of modern living.
Some of the patterns have decayed,
and we're giving
them back to move away.

Down comes the rain,
and it whispers to me
that some of the stains
are beginning to breath.

Clouds rumble dark.
There's a chill to the wind.
The droplets will mark
where your lips touch my skin.

I smell the air.
The pavement glistens as the water pools there
to clean the earth,
and if you count you'll see it's hard to find find the worth

of little things.
Like a sentence or a flower.
Causing feeling brings
out a part of who you are.

Where is the sun?
I guess it's hiding till the troubled skies have run 
their course again,
and there's no telling how long it will take to mend

the fractured souls
of those who couldn't change.
The thunder rolls
across the mountain range.
